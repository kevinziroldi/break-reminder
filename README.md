# Break reminder app

## Description 
Break reminder is an app that allows you to choose a timer duration and set a timer.  
Once the timer elapses, the app sends you a notification reminding you to take a break.

## Tools 
This app was realised using Go for backend and HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend, thanks to Wails.  
It also uses a third party library, called Beeep, in order to send desktop notifications when a timer elapses.
